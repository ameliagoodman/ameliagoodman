    <h4>Apple, Inc.</h4>
    <p align="justify">In the summer of 2016, I worked as an intern for the Edge Services team at Apple. I worked with the GSLB team doing full-stack development on CDN management tools.</p>
  
    <h4>AMC Networks Intern</h4>
    <p align="justify">In the summer of 2015, I worked as an intern for both the Digital Production and Development team and for the Project Management team in the IT Department. With the Digital Production team, I designed and coded (using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, and CSS) a dynamic, mock, corporate website for future adaptation. I also worked with experienced developers to understand and merge user needs with corporate demands. During my time with the Project Management team, I assisted the project managers with the production and deployment of about twenty technology projects, having the most influence transferring all AMCN employees to Office 365. I created detailed reports for each project so supervisors and team members could track their progress and created an intranet site for the IT department.</p>

    <h3 align="center">Web Design</h3><br>
    <h4>Website Design Consultant</h4>
    <p align="justify">I also work as a website design consultant for a few different projects. I completely re-vamped the website for the organization <a href="http://evc.org/" target="_blank">EVC</a>. This project lasted a few months, taking all of the information from the old site and reformatting it, designing the entire site from the ground up. For this project, I used a pre-made WordPress theme with injections of my own HTML, CSS, and PHP code.</p>
    <p align="justify">I designed and coded the <a href="http://techitoutphilly.com" target="_blank">Tech it Out Philly</a> website using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and MaterializeCSS.</p>
    <p align="justify">I designed and coded the <a href="http://wics.cis.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Penn WiCS</a> website using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and BootStrap.</p>
    <p align="justify">I designed and coded the <a href="http://femmehacks.io/" target="_blank">FemmeHacks</a> website using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and BootStrap.</p>
    <p align="justify">I built and manage the <a href="http://writeonpenn.org/" target="_blank">Write On!</a> website using a pre-made WordPress theme and pieces of my own HTML and CSS.</p>

    <h3 align="center">Teaching</h3><br>

    <h4>Tech it Out Philly Director</h4>
    <p align="justify">I wrote and teach the curriculum for Tech it Out Philly, which teaches web development to Philadelphia public high school students. These students have no knowledge of CS before the program, so we teach basic CS skills and go in depth into web dev. Learn more <a href="techitoutphilly.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>University of Pennsylvania Tutor</h4>
    <p align="justify">During the school year, I work one-on-one with Penn students, helping them understand concepts and problem-solving strategies for calculus and computer science programming classes. I usually work with about four students per semester, and I meet with each student once a week.</p>
  
    <h4>Penn Emerging Scholars Program Teaching Assistant</h4>
    <p align="justify">The Penn Emerging Scholars Program works to increase the presence of women and minorities in math and computer science fields at the University of Pennsylvania. Once a week, I teach an introductory lesson to topics in math and computer science, like cryptography, graph theory, the Pigeon Hole Principle, and more. Because the group is primarily aimed at those who fall within minority groups that have been historically discouraged from STEM, PESP creates an environment where these students may explore STEM where they might not have been able to previously.</p>

    <h4>Write On! Coordinator</h4>
    <p align="justify">Write On! is an organization I hold very near to my heart. I joined Write On! in the first weeks of my Freshman year at Penn, and have been involved ever since. Write On! consists of a group of Penn students who work with students of an under-resourced, low-income middle school in West Philadelphia. Each Friday for about three hours, we write creatively with middle school students. We work with them to write poems, tell stories, build a character, choreograph a dance, write a rap, and express themselves through a creative medium. In my third year, I began coordinating the program, which means I write the weekly syllabi that the coaches (what we call the Penn students) use to guide their work with the kids. I also created and maintain the <a href="http://writeonpenn.org/" target="_blank">Write On! website</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/upenn.writeon">social</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/writeon.upenn/">media</a> so that the kids can view and share their work at any time.</p>
